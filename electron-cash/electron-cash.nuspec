    <summary>Lightweight SPV wallet for Bitcoin Cash</summary>
    <description>
Electron Cash gives you what you love about the popular Electrum Bitcoin wallet, but for Bitcoin Cash. Control your own private keys. Back up your wallet easily with a mnemonic seed phrase. SPV technology provides high security without having to download the blockchain or run a full node.

We have forked the Electrum code repository and added the necessary components for operation with Bitcoin Cash. Some Multisig and hardware add-ons are not supported.

#### Note on Virus Scan Results
Some (minor) scan engines are falsely detecting the Electron Cash executable as malicious (false positive).
The authors are aware and working on it, sister projects are also affected (see also [1](https://github.com/fyookball/electrum/issues/335), [2](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/3198)).
