    <summary>Lightweight SPV wallet for Bitcoin Cash</summary>
    <description>
Electron Cash gives you what you love about the popular Electrum Bitcoin wallet, but for Bitcoin Cash. Control your own private keys. Back up your wallet easily with a mnemonic seed phrase. SPV technology provides high security without having to download the blockchain or run a full node.

We have forked the Electrum code repository and added the necessary components for operation with Bitcoin Cash. Some Multisig and hardware add-ons are not supported.

#### Note on Virus Scan Results
Some (minor) scan engines are falsely detecting the Electron Cash executable as malicious (false positive).
The authors are aware and working on it, sister projects are also affected (see also [1](https://github.com/fyookball/electrum/issues/335), [2](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/3198)).

    <releaseNotes>
### Release 3.3.6

  * Support for op_return_raw= URI parameter to 'bitcoincash:' URIs. This
    paremeter is for raw hex to be used as the OP_RETURN payload (0x6a will
    always be prefixed to this raw hex.) (markblundeberg)
  * Testnet wallets were using the wrong bip32 key headers. They SHOULD
    accept and generate tpub/tprv on testnet but instead the keys generated were
    xpub/xprv. This was not to spec and has been fixed but, it may mean you will
    need to regenerate your testnet wallets form mnemonic seed. :/ (cculianu)
  * Added "Check for updates..." mechanism which is enabled by default
    (check is done once per hour). See Preferences -> General to disable auto
    check. Or Help -> "Check for updates..." for manual checking. (cculianu)
  * Added "Dark" theme to UI. See Preferences -> General (cculianu)
  * Fixed incompatibility bug where generated QR images were uppercase-only
    BITCOINCASH: which caused problems with some buggy wallet implementations. We
    switched back to generating 'bitcoincash:' (mixed-case) URIs, which is more
    compatible. (cculianu)
  * Added "Export contacts" facility to UI so you can export all your contacts to
    a file. (Strangely, we had "Import contacts", but no export!) (cculianu)
  * Added "Wallet -> Rebuild history" to Qt GUI. Allows users to re-synch entire
    wallet from server, on demand. (commit: a72b2a72, cculianu)
  * Request fee estimate from ElectrumX/ElectronX server every 20 minutes
    (cculianu)
